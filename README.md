# rofacts
A repository used for creating visualisations of different economic and social indicators related to Romania

I have two apps in this repository. They are simillar in the frontend but the streamlit_app.py uses a .csv file as a data source while the streamlit_app_wbgapi.py uses the world bank api to get the data. The later is the better way of doing it
